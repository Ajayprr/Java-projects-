Description:

Input The program should take two command line arguments.
First one is a directory name. If the directory is omitted from the command line, it is an error. The program should display an
error message and terminate. The error message should indicate what went wrong. If the directory name is provided, but it is
not a name of a valid directory, the program should display an error message and terminate. The error message should indicate
what went wrong.
The second one is the maximum number of largest files found in the directory provided as the first argument. If the number is
missing, the default value of 20 should be used.
Output Your program should determine and print to standard output the total space used by the directory in question (that
includes the sizes or all the files and subdirectories contained in it). The program should also print the sizes and pathnames of
the largest files. (See Homework 2.pdf for more info)
