Description:

You are given the program that performs image segmentation. The implemented algorithm is based on the depth first search
approach to region growing. This solution needs to use a stack to keep track of the pixels that need to be visited and evaluated.
Currently it is using the stack implementation from the Java API. (See Homework 4.pdf for more info)
